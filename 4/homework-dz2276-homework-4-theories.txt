Homework 4

-------------------------------------

Problem 1:

Consider the following array of integers: a = [3, 9, 7, 8, 2, 5, 1]

a) Show the result of inserting the integers in a one by one into an initially empty min-heap.
Then show the result of calling deleteMin on the heap 3 times. After each insertion and
deleteMin step, show the array and the tree structure it represents.

A:

b) Sort the array using in-place using Heap Sort. First show the result of turning a into a
max heap using the linear time algorithm to build a heap (submit only the final array). Then
show the array after each deleteMax step. The last step should be an array sorted in
increasing order.

A:

Problem 2:

Give a big-O bound for the space required to store each of the following trees:

a) A complete binary tree with N nodes that, in addition, has two extra levels (that is, it is
very slightly unbalanced).

A:

b) a binary tree that has a deepest node at depth 2 log N.

A:

c) a binary tree that has a deepest node at depth 4.1 log N.

A:

d) the worst case binary tree.

A:

Problem 1 (21 pts)

The object of the Kevin Bacon Game is to link a movie actor to Kevin
Bacon via shared movie roles. The minimum number of links is an
actor’s Bacon number. For instance, Tom Hanks has a Bacon number of 1;
he was in Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Sally Field has a Bacon number
of 2, because she was in Forrest Gump with Tom Hanks, who was in
Apollo 13 with Kevin Bacon. Almost all well-known actors have a Bacon
number of 1 or 2. Assume that you have a comprehensive list of of (Actor, Movie) pairs.

  - (a) Explain how to find an actor’s Bacon number.

  A:


  - (b) Explain how to find the actor with the highest Bacon number.

  A:


  - (c) Explain how to find the minimum number of links between two arbitrary actors.

  A:

Problem 2 (21 pts)

Consider the recursive algorithm below for finding the
shortest weighted path in an acyclic graph, from s to t.

  - (a) Why does this algorithm not work for general graphs?

  A:


  - (b) Explain why this algorithm is guaranteed to terminate for acyclic graphs.

  A:


  - (c) What is the worst-case running time of the algorithm?

  A:

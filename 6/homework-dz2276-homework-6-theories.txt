Problem 1 (10 pts)

Use  Kruskal's  algorithm  to  find  the  minimum  spanning  tree  on  the  following graph.
Show  the forest maintained after each step.

A:

-------------------------------------

Problem 2 (10 pts)

Provide an example directed graph *G* in which Dijkstra's algorithm will produce the wrong result
because *G* contains a negative weight edge (but no negative cost cycle).

Show a run of Dijkstra's algorithm that provides the wrong result (i.e. doesn't find the correct shortest path cost for a
node).

A:

-------------------------------------

Problem 3 (10 pts)

A bipartite graph *G= (V; E)* is a graph whose vertices *V* can be partitioned into two disjoint sets *V₁* and *V₂*,
such that every edge connects a vertex in *V₁* to one in *V₂*.

For every edge *(u,v)* either *u ∈ V₁* and *v ∈ V₂*, or *u ∈ V₂* and *v ∈ V₁*.

For example, the following graph is bipartite with  *V₁={A,B,C,D}* and *V₂={E,F,G}*.

Describe an algorithm (in pseudocode or in your own words) that detects if a graph is bipartite.

Your algorithm should run in *O(|V|+|E|)*.

Hint: Try to modify breadth first search.

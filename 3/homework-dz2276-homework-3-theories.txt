Homework 3

-------------------------------------

Problem 1:

(a) Assume you start with an empty Binary Search Tree. Show the result of inserting
3,7,2,8,9,4,5 into the tree (in this sequence). Is the tree balanced? If not, where
is the balance condition violated?

			3
		  /	  \
		2		7
			  /   \
			4		8
			  \		  \
				5		9

The tree is not balanced.
The root of the tree has a left subtree of height 0, but has a right subtree of height 2,
which differ by 2 (more than 1).

(b) Show the result of deleting the root of the tree from part (a) (using the convention for
the deletion operation made in class).

			4
		  /	  \
		2		7
			  /   \
			5		8
			   		  \
				 		9

-------------------------------------

Problem 2:

Show the result of inserting 3,7,2,8,9,4,5 (in this sequence) into an initially empty AVL
tree. You do not need to draw all intermediate trees, but please pecify which rotations are
needed (if any) and around which node.

			3
		  /	  \
		2		7
			      \
					8
			   		  \
				 		9

insert(9) would violate the balance around node 7. Outside case. Single rotation is needed.

			3
		  /	  \
		2		8
			  /   \
			7		9
		  /
		4

insert(4) would violate the balance around node 3. Inside case. Double rotation is needed.

			7
		  /	  \
		3		8
	  /	  \	      \
	2	   	4		9

insert(5) would not violate the balance.

			7
		  /	  \

			  \
				5
